Step 1 — Create the 4 example .txt files

Format you required:

    First line: DATA_WIDTH COEF_WIDTH

    Remaining lines: integer coefficients (one per line).

    Coefficients are quantized filter taps in signed integer format.

I’ll generate small examples with realistic FIR coefficients (scaled to integer range for given widths) for:

    Low-pass

    High-pass

    Band-pass

    Band-stop

These are quantized symmetric FIR coefficients based on prototype designs, scaled to fit 13-bit signed integer range (±4095). They are ready to drop into your simulation and satisfy the file format you defined.
